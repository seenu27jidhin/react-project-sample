# React + Vite
Shopping carts are one of the most common things you will build as a web developer, but there is a lot that goes into building a good shopping cart. In this project I will show you how to build a fully functional shopping cart using React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. 

first of all install some thing in to your project

1)npm create vite . (Press Enter for install this)

we have some options, so select the framework - React (Press Enter)
again select varient ,so click react-ts (Press Enter)

Then enter npm i (Press Enter)

We need to install bootstap ,so type 

2)npm i react-router-dom bootstrap react-bootstrap (Press Enter)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
